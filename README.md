Five-Multiplayer is a multiplayer modification for the game called "Grand Theft Auto V" created by Rockstar Games and published by Take-Two Interactive Software.
Five Multiplayer is in no way affiliated with Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive. The 'Grand Theft Auto' and the 'Grand Theft Auto' logos are trademarks of Take-Two Interactive Software.

# Compiling

In order to compile the mod, it is recommended to use *Visual Studio 2015* or [*Visual Studio CE (Community Edition) 2015*](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx) if possible. Otherwise the mod may not work / may crash during the loading screen.
As of now, the mod can be compiled in *debug mode x64* and *release mode x64*. The main solution file can be found in *FiveMP\Launcher (Launcher.sln)*. FiveMP does not support any 32 bit builds due to the fact that Grand Theft Auto V is a 64 bit game!

# Binaries

After compiling the mod, Release binaries can be found in *FiveMP\bin\Release* and Debug binaries in *FiveMP\bin\Debug*.
Double clicking *FiveMP.exe* should start the mod and start a new game. Binaries need to be outside your *Grand Theft Auto V* folder (client files) and they should all be within the **same** directory for the mod to work, the INI file however **always** needs to be in the *Grand Theft Auto V* folder. Except for the server files, you can place these anywhere as long as their own files are in the **same directory**.
